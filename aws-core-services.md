### 1. Understanding of core AWS services, uses, and basic AWS architecture best practices
Aws compute
EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud allows you to easily scale virtual machines for your main compute horsepower; note that an opposite approach in AWS is serverless compute with Lambda
Aws storage
S3: Simple Storage Services is object-based, key/value storage for many purposes in AWS
EBS: Elastic Block Store permits the use of MDD or SDD storage for many purposes, including boot volumes for EC2 instances
Aws database
RDS: Relational Database Service allows you to host many database types in the cloud; this includes Oracle, MS SQL Server, and even Amazon’s own Aurora
DynamoDB: a NoSQL database option in the cloud that performs blazing performance and on-demand scalability
Elastic cache: creates in-memory caches for impressive performance interaction; this service also supports open standards in caching
Aws networking
VPC: Virtual Private Cloud provides the networking components needed for an infrastructure including subsets, gateways, routing tables, and security mechanisms
Aws management
CloudWatch: Permits the monitoring of key services; uses metrics and alarms for a familiar monitoring approach
CloudTrail: Permits the tracking of potentially all the API calls to AWS; this allows you detailed analysis of all events no matter the source – Web Console, CLI, SDK, etc.
Aws security
IAM: Identity and Access Management allows the creation of users, groups, and roles for interacting securely with AWS
Aws application integration
SNS:the Simple Notification Service allows the generation of email and text notifications based on AWS events
SQS: the Simple Queue Service assists you in decoupling components and queuing messages between these components; this service helps the use of micro services for your processing needs
